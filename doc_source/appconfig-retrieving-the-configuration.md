# Step 6: Receiving the configuration<a name="appconfig-retrieving-the-configuration"></a>

You must configure a client to receive configuration updates by integrating with the [GetConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_GetConfiguration.html) API action\. You can integrate using the AWS SDK\. The following AWS CLI command demonstrates how to receive a configuration\. This call includes the IDs of the AWS AppConfig application, the environment, the configuration profile, and a unique client ID\. The configuration content is saved to the output filename\. 

**Note**  
The `client-id` parameter in the following command is a unique, user\-specified ID to identify the client for the configuration\. This ID enables AWS AppConfig to deploy the configuration in intervals, as defined in the deployment strategy\. 

```
aws appconfig get-configuration \
    --application application_name_or_ID \
    --environment environment_name_or_ID \
    --configuration configuration_profile_name_or_ID \
    --client-id client_ID \
output_filename
```

The system responds with information in the following format\.

```
{
   "ConfigurationVersion":"configuration version",
   "ContentType":"content type"
}
```

**Important**  
Note the following important details about the `GetConfiguration` API action:  
The `GetConfiguration` response includes a `Content` section that shows the configuration data\. The `Content` section only appears if the system finds new or updated configuration data\. If the system doesn't find new or updated configuration data, then the `Content` section is not returned \(`Null`\)\.
AWS AppConfig uses the value of the `ClientConfigurationVersion` parameter to identify the configuration version on your clients\. If you donâ€™t send `ClientConfigurationVersion` with each call to `GetConfiguration`, your clients receive the current configuration\. You are charged each time your clients receive a configuration\.
To avoid excess charges, we recommend that you include the `ClientConfigurationVersion` value with every call to `GetConfiguration`\. This value must be saved on your client\. Subsequent calls to `GetConfiguration` must pass this value by using the `ClientConfigurationVersion` parameter, as shown here\. 

Sending `ConfigurationVersion` during subsequent polling for configuration updates is similar to the concept of [HTTP ETags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag)\.

```
aws appconfig get-configuration \
    --application application_name_or_ID \
    --environment environment_name_or_ID \
    --configuration configuration_profile_name_or_ID \
    --client-configuration-version previous_configuration_version_value \
    --client-id client_ID \
output_filename
```

**Note**  
We recommend tuning the polling frequency of your `GetConfiguration` API calls based on your budget, the expected frequency of your configuration deployments, and the number of targets for a configuration\.
